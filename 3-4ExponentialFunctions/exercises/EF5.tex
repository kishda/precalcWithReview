\begin{exercise}

In a laboratory, there is a culture with a certain number $P_0$ of bacteria. Let's say that $t$ hours after the initial observation, the population of bacteria is $P(t)$, and that it grows at a rate of $22\%$ per hour. Given that one hour after the initial observation the population is of $P(1) = 120$ bacteria, what is the amount of bacteria we have in the culture after four hours? Round your answer to the nearest integer. $P(4)\cong \answer{218}$
