\begin{exercise}

  A population has $6000$ people at time $t=0$, where $t$ is measured in years.

  \begin{exercise}
    If the population decreases by $250$ people by year, the population $P(t)$ after $t$ years equals $P(t) = \answer{6000-250t}$.
  \end{exercise}


  \begin{exercise}
      If the population decreases by $8\%$ by year, the population $P(t)$ after $t$ years equals $P(t) = \answer{6000(0.92)^t}$.
