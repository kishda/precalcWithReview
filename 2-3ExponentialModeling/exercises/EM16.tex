\begin{exercise}

  A solar energy company sold $\$80,000$ worth of solar collectors
  last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to
  $\$88,000$. The marketing department must estimate its projected
  sales for the next few years.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
  \item If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow
    linearly, what sales total should it expect next year? Answer:
    $\answer{96000}$ dollars.
    \begin{hint} Write $L(t) = mt+b$, find
      $m$ and $b$, and compute $L(2)$.
    \end{hint}
  \item If the marketing department predicts that sales will grow
    exponentially, what sales total should it expect next year?
    Answer: $\answer{96800}$ dollars. \begin{hint} Write $E(t)
      =E_0b^t$, find $E_0$ and $b$, and compute $E(2)$.
    \end{hint}
  \end{enumerate}
