\begin{exercise}

The height of an object dropped from the roof of an eight story building is modeled by $h(t) = -16t^2 + 64$, where $0 \le t \le 2$. Here, $h$ is the height of the object off the ground in feet, $t$ seconds after the object is dropped. 

The slope of the line through the points $(0, h(0))$ and $(2, h(2))$ is $\answer{-32}$.
