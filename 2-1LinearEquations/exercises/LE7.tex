Parallel lines

\begin{definition}
Two lines in the plane are \dfn{parallel} if they never intersect, no matter how far they are extended. Any two vertical lines are parallel.  Any two horizontal lines are parallel. Two non-vertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Suppose a line has equation $y = 3x + 4$. An equation of the line parallel to this line, with $y$-intercept at $(0, -2)$ is given in slope-intercept form by
	$y = \answer{3}x + \answer{-2}$.

	\item Suppose a line has equation $x = -2$. An equation of the line parallel to this, which passes through the point $(4, 2)$ has equation $x = \answer{4}$.

	\item Suppose a line has equation $5x + 2y = -4$. An equation of the line parallel to this, which passes through the point $(2, -3)$ is given in point-slope form by $y - \answer{-3} = \answer{-5/2}\left( x - \answer{2} \right)$.

\end{enumerate}
