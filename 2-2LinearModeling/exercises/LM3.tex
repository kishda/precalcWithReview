Your friend buys a new car, and as soon as they drive it off the lot, it begins to depreciate in value. After 2 years, the car is worth \$$16,000$ and after 4 years, the car is worth \$$12,000$. Assume that the car's value drops linearly. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item A linear function $V$ that expresses the value of the car in terms of
the number of years $x$ since it was purchased is $V(x) = \answer{-2000x + 20000}$. 

\item The $y$-intercept of the function $V$ is $(\answer{0},\answer{20000})$.

\item The $y$ value of the $y$-intercept represents
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{the starting value of the car.}
\choice{the time at which the car's value is 0.}
\choice{the average value of the car over its lifespan.}
\end{multipleChoice}

\item The $x$-intercept of the function $V$ is $(\answer{40}, \answer{0})$.

\item The $x$ value of the $x$-intercept represents
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{the starting value of the car.}
\choice[correct]{the time at which the car's value is 0.}
\choice{the average value of the car over its lifespan.}
\end{multipleChoice}
