Give exact solutions without using a computational device.%

A camera is tracking the launch of a SpaceX rocket. The camera is located $4000$' from the rocket's launching pad, and the camera elevates in order to keep the rocket in focus. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item At what angle, is the camera tilted when the rocket is $3000$' off the ground? Answer both exactly.%
\par
\item[] Now, rather than considering the rocket at a fixed height of $3000$ ft, let its height vary and call the rocket's height $h$. 

\item Determine the camera's angle, $\theta$ as a function of $h$, and compute the average rate of change of $\theta$ on the intervals $[3000,3500]$, $[5000,5500]$, and $[7000,7500]$. 

\item What do you observe about how the camera angle is changing?%
\end{enumerate}
